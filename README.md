# LLM Project

## Project Task
The project topic that I chose was sentiment analysis using the idmb dataset. Sentiment analysis will allow me to understand context-specific sentiments and slangs. Using the idmb dataset with a pre-trained language model, the goal is to classify reviews as either positive or negative.

## Dataset
The dataset is called IMDB Movie Reviews and contains 50,000 reviews. 25,000 are for training and 25,000 for testing. You can find the dataset here: [https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanfordnlp/imdb]

## Pre-trained Model
The pre-trained model used is DistilBERT which is a distilled version of BERT. It is a smaller, faster, cheaper and lighter version that run 60% faster while perserving 95% of BERT's performances.

## Performance Metrics
The performance metrics for this model will be evaluated with the following metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 Score.

The results for the datasets can be viewed in the following notebooks: 2-representation and 3-pre-trained-models.

## Hyperparameters
(fill in details about which hyperparemeters you found most important/relevant while optimizing your model)
