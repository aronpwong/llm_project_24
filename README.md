# LLM Project

## Project Task
The project topic that I chose was sentiment analysis using the idmb dataset. Sentiment analysis will allow me to understand context-specific sentiments and slangs. Using the idmb dataset with a pre-trained language model, the goal is to classify reviews as either positive or negative.

## Dataset
The dataset is called IMDB Movie Reviews and contains 50,000 reviews. 25,000 are for training and 25,000 for testing. You can find the dataset here [https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanfordnlp/imdb]
